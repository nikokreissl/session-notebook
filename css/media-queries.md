## Media queries

Can be used to change the appearance if certain occasions appear.

`@media (min-/max-widht: 500px) { selector-here }`
Like this you can change styles if the screen has a certain width or height.

`@media (pefers-color-scheme: dark) { selector-here }`
Like this you can show the website by default in dark mode when a user opens it with dark mode e.g. in the night.
