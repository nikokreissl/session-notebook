## Event listener

To react to anything the user does (`events`) event listeners need written.

They are working as follows:

`variable.addEventListener("event", () => { })`

Explanation:

- `variable` = Name of the variable (element)
- `addEventListener` = tells JS that an event needs to happen
- `event` = which type of event, e.g. `click, scroll, etc`
- `=>` fat arrow
- `{ }` function body, what should happen on the certain event
